<h1>The Best movies according to Amancio</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

 <h3>Aladdin</h3>
 <p>Love this movie because I watched it as a child and genie made the whole movie captivating. It was also fun to watch aladdin and Jasmin fall in love</p>
 <h3>Wall-e</h3>
 <p> okay you got me, I'm a sucker for romance. I'm also a sucker for robots so this was the perfect movie for me</p>
 <h3>Your Name</h3>
